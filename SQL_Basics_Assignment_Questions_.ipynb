        ": age (integer, should have a check constraint to ensure the age is at least 18)Q\n",

        ": salary (decimal, with a default value of 30,000).\n",

        "2. Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provide\n",
        "examples of common types of constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans -Constraints maintain data integrity by enforcing rules on table data (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT).\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify\n",
        "your answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-NOT NULL ensures a column cannot have NULL values. A primary key cannot contain NULL because it must uniquely identify each row.\n",

        "4. Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. Provide an\n",

        "Ans-Insertion/update/delete failing if rules break (e.g., duplicate in UNIQUE column). Example:\n",
